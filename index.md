# Open Kidney Data
## Fine-grained Annotated Ultrasound for Medical Image Analysis

### Introduction

Ultrasound imaging is a portable, real-time, non-ionizing, and non-invasive imaging modality. It is the first line for numerous organs, including the kidney. With recent advances in technology, the world of artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced ultrasound is imminently upon us. However, there is a lack of open ultrasound data for researchers to use.
