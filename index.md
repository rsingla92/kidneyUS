# Open Kidney Dataset
## Fine-grained Annotated Ultrasound for Medical Image Analysis

### Introduction

Ultrasound imaging is a portable, real-time, non-ionizing, and non-invasive imaging modality. It is the first line for numerous organs, including the kidney. With recent advances in technology, the world of artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced ultrasound is imminently upon us. However, compared to other modalities like CT or MRI, there is a lack of open ultrasound data available for researchers to use.

We present the Open Kidney Dataset. It includes over 500 abdominal ultrasound images and two sets of fine-grained polygon annotations from four classes that are available for non-commericial use.

### Motivation
Artificial intelligence for medical imaging has seen unprecedented growth in the last ten years. As a result of the creation of imaging data being made available to researchers, cornerstone algorithms like U-net have been created. However, in the field of ultrasound, there is a lack of data available. This is in part due to difficulty in acessing medical imaging data as well as anonymization and privacy considerations. However, even in competititions within biomedical imaging such as the The MICCAI Segmentation Decathalon, ultrasound is underrpresented. The lack of data accentuates the growing reproducibility crisis within the ultrasound machine learning field. To the best of our knowledge there is no widely available kidney ultrasound dataset that exists.

To further expand and improve academic efforts for machine learning in ultrasound, we present the Open Kidney Dataset.
