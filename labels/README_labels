This subfolder contains:

* CSV files for each sonographer's annotations. Each CSV is generated from the VGG Image Annotator. 
* In each CSV file, a single record includes the file name of the image, the size, attributes and polygon coordinates for each annotated region.
* Attributes include quality, view type, and brief comments from the sonographer. 
* Polygon coordinates are manually generated by each individual sonographer.
